== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin works ? =

For the post views, the plugin works by replacing the post content with the data of the selected fields in the administration panel and it does this by using a wordpress filter function (**add_filter**) making the changes on-the-fly without any file modification. As for the list views, the plugins simply uses wordpress shortcodes to display the views.

= So this will work with any custom post type/fields ? =

No. Most custom post type plugins store the necessary information in diferent tables and in diferent ways so it is impossible to make this plugin to work will all custom post type/field. Currently this plugins only works with custom post types created by plugins specified in the description/installation pages.

= Are you going to add suport for more custom post type plugins ? =

Depends. The custom post type plugins that this plugin supports are very complete, and my opinion, the best plugins for creating custom post types, so it might not be worth it to add more, especially since some of them might take too much work. If someone sends me code for 'plugincode' or 'fieldtypes' folders or if the the plugin in question is widely used, I might add it.

= Is it possible add/remove/modify templates ? =

Yes. All the code relative to templates in this plugin are located in the 'templates/post' and 'templates/list' folder. In each folder there is a file called 'template_manual' that contains the necessary information to create/modify a tempate.

= Is it possible add/remove/modify types options in the 'Post Views' page and fields meta box in the 'List View' page ? =

Yes. All the code relative to field types in this plugin are located in the 'fieldtypes' folder and can be easily changed. In that folder there is a file called 'cvpg_fieldtype_manual' that contains the necessary information to create/modify a field type. The most simple filetype that can be used as an example is the 'date' file type.

= How can add support for other custom post type/fields plugin ? =

If you are familiar the custom post type/fields plugin that you are using or you created the custom post type youself and know how extract the its information, you can extend this plugin support by creating the appropiate file in the 'pluginscode' folder. In that folder there is a file called 'cpvg_plugincode_manual' that contains the necessary information to add support for a custom post type plugin.
