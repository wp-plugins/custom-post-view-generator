== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin works ? =

Without any theme modification, the only data that will be displayed, when viewing a custom post type, will be the post content (the content inserted in the post content editor) since the theme doesn't know existence of additional fields. So the plugin works by replacing the post content with the data of the selected custom fields in the administration panel (and the post content if the administrator selects it) and it does this by using a wordpress filter function (**add_filter**) making the changes on-the-fly without any file modification.

= So this will work with any custom post type/custom post fields ? =

No. The custom post fields can store information in endless ways and it is impossible automaticly determine the type of certain custom post field. There also endless ways to store information about existing custom post types, so it is also impossible determine the existing custom post type and its fields wihout adding the necessary code to extract that information. Currently this plugins only works with custom post types created by plugins specified in the description/installation pages.

= There are no custom post types in the 'Post Type' in the 'Post Views' page. Why ? =

Assuming that you created custom post types, most likelly you created those custom post types using other plugin other the ones that were recommended in the description/installation pages and if read the second answer on this F.A.Q. you will understand why. **NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS:** If you are familiar the custom post type plugin that you are using or you created the custom post type youself and know how extract the its information, you can extend this plugin support by creating the appropiate file in the 'pluginscode' folder. Use 'cpvg_plugincode_manual' file as a template, rename it and add the php extension.

= Is it possible change/add types options in the 'Post Views' page ? =

Yes. All the code relative to field types in this plugin are located in the 'fieldtypes' folder and can be easily changed. To create a new filetype you can use 'cvpg_fieldtype_manual' file as a template, rename it and add the php extension. The most simple filetype that you can analyse is the 'date' file type.

= Are you going to add suport for more custom post type plugins ? =

Depends. The custom post type plugins that this plugin supports are very complete, and my opinion, the best plugins for creating custom post types, so it might not be worth it to add more, especially since some of them might take too much work. If someone sends me code for 'plugincode' or 'fieldtypes' folders I most likelly add it and I might add support for other plugins but at the moment, I not thinking of adding support for more plugins.

= Is it possible change/add templates ? =

Yes. All the code relative to templates in this plugin are located in the 'templates' folder. To create a new template you can use 'template_manual' file as a template, rename it and add the php extension.
